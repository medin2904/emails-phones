# emails-phones
This program checks for emails and phone numbers in a copied text.

How it works:
1. Copy a whole PDF documents, word text, website or anything else!
2. Run the program (NOTE: It will not return ANY results)
3. Open up a word document and email and paste! When you paste, it will paste only phone numbers and emails that were found in the text that you copied before running the program.
